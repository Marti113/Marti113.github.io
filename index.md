Welcome to my website!

I started programming back in 2016. In 2018, I decided to round out my self-taught studies with CS classes at City College SF.  

My previous professional experience is mostly in the Non-Profit sector. At my last Non-Profit, The Night Ministry, I worked with homeless youth in Chicago. These kids had limited options for future careers. 

I saw potential in them to learn programming and become developers. It's easy to say but I knew if I could learn to be a programmer, I could inspire anyone to be a programmer. 

Beyond being an awesome engineer, I want to volunteer with Girls who Code and other STEM focused organizations for kids. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading. Please check out my resume and projects.
